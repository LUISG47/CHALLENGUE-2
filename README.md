# STOCKS SUMMARY SCRIPT

## Description

Welcome to this project! This is a VBA Script to help you get a summary of behaviour of stocks listed on a given year with details on the open, close prices and volumes transacted in each Q of the year

## Functions:

This code will help you to run on all of your worksheets at once and get a resume of:

1. The ticker symbol
2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.


The script will also return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

This should be a very helpful script if you're trying to get the behaviour of stock prices in every Q of the year!

## Instructions

1. Open the sample excel to see how your data must be ordered
2. Insert the script on visual basic editor
3. Run the macro _stocks_
